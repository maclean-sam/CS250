How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this? It is always important to pay attention to the user side of a project since they are the ones who determine the success of the product. Creating user stories is a highly effective way to visualize what the user wants to see from the project which gives the team a first hand look into how they can create the most effective user based product possible. User needs can be considered and approaches can be mapped out to better understand whether the idea will be beneficial to the project.

How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work? Approaching development should contain a high amount of communication among team members rather than a solo process. It is important to understand where the rest of the team is at in terms of progress and how the vision for the project might change over time. Proper planning in agile will be incorporated into my future development work since I occasionally run into problems with a program that could have been identified earlier.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development? A good team member in software development communicates well with the rest of the team and makes consistent progress according to plan. Making sure everyone else is on the right track and making sure not to get ahead of yourself are additional ways to be a good team member and show that you care about the project. Everyone should know how to be a good team member because it will lead to a better project due to a team that understands each other well.
